# Passphraser

Convert any data to a passphrase and back.

Currently, only the BIP-39 wordlist is supported.

## Use cases

- Make a long code more readable, communicable, and less error-prone by converting it to a passphrase.

## How does it work?
- [ ] Describe the algorithm

## TODO
### Now

- [ ] Add input modes: "hex", "bin", "str". Currently only hex input is supported.
- [ ] Add optional numbered output like this:
```
19      across
1624    slab
218     brass
139     bacon
```

### Later
- [ ] Add options for wordlists: built-in and user-defined
- [ ] Package for PyPI
